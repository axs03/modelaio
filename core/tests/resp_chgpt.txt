**Definition**
A binary number is a number expressed in the base-2 numeral system, using only the symbols 0 and 1 to represent values. 
Each symbol in a binary number is called a bit, short for “binary digit,” and serves as the fundamental unit of information in computing. 
In a positional notation, each bit’s place value corresponds to an increasing power of two, with the rightmost bit representing 2⁰, the next representing 2¹, and so on. 
Binary numerals may include a radix point (analogous to a decimal point) to represent fractions, where positions to the right represent negative powers of two. 
The term “binary number” can also refer to dyadic rationals—fractions whose denominator is a power of two—that have finite representations in base-2.

**About**
Binary numbers are the backbone of all modern digital electronics and computing systems because physical circuits naturally support two distinct states (e.g., on/off, high/low voltage), corresponding directly to 1 and 0. 
In computer processors, binary code encodes both data and instructions, enabling arithmetic and logical operations via simple logic gates that perform bitwise operations like AND, OR, XOR, and NOT. 
Bitwise operations manipulate individual bits within binary words to optimize computations such as masking, shifting, and flag testing. 
Programmers often denote binary literals in source code with prefixes (e.g., 0b1010) or suffixes (e.g., 1010b) to distinguish them from decimal constants. 
The inherent simplicity and noise immunity of two-state systems make binary representation far more reliable and efficient for hardware implementation than higher-radix systems.
