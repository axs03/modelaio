**Definition**
Binary numbers form the foundation of digital systems, using a base-2 numeral system composed of only two digits: 0 and 1. 
Each digit, called a bit, represents a power of 2, with positions increasing from right to left (e.g., 2⁰, 2¹, 2²). 
For example, the binary number 101 translates to 5 in decimal (1×2² + 0×2¹ + 1×2⁰). 
This system contrasts with the decimal system (base-10), which uses digits 0-9 and powers of 10. 
Binary’s simplicity aligns with electronic hardware, where 0 and 1 correspond to “off” and “on” states in circuits.  

**About**
Binary numbers are integral to computing, enabling data storage, processing, and communication. 
Computers use binary to represent all information—text, images, and instructions—as sequences of bits. 
Logical operations (AND, OR, NOT) and arithmetic are performed using binary-based logic gates within processors. 
Networks and storage devices also rely on binary, transmitting or saving data as encoded 0s and 1s. 
Despite their efficiency for machines, binary is rarely used directly by humans, who interact with higher-level abstractions like programming languages or user interfaces.
