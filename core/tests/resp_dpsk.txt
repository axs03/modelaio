Binary numbers are a base-2 numbering system, using only two digits: **0** and **1**. Each digit represents a power of 2, much like each digit in decimal (base-10) represents a power of 10. For example, the binary number **1011** translates to:  
(1 × 2³) + (0 × 2²) + (1 × 2¹) + (1 × 2⁰) = **11** in decimal.  

Binary is fundamental in computing because digital electronics (like CPUs and memory) operate using **on/off states** (represented by 1 and 0). This simplicity allows reliable processing, storage, and transmission of data. All complex operations—math, text, images, and programs—are ultimately broken down into binary for computers to execute efficiently.  

Beyond hardware, binary enables **Boolean logic** (AND, OR, NOT), which underpins programming, cryptography, and data compression. Its efficiency in representing logical states makes it indispensable in technology.
